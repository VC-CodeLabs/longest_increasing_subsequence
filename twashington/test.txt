Example Test 1: Basic Test Case
Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Expected Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101].

Example Test Case 2: All Elements are Increasing
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Output: 9
Explanation: The entire array is the longest increasing subsequence.

Example Test Case 3: All Elements are Decreasing
Input: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Expected Output: 1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is any single element, as no two elements form an increasing subsequence.

Example Test Case 4: Single Element
Input: [5]
Expected Output: 1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [5].

Example Test Case 5: Duplicate Elements
Input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Expected Output: 1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is any single element, as no two elements form an increasing subsequence.

Example Test Case 6: Alternating Increase and Decrease
Input: [1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]
Expected Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 5] or [1, 3, 4, 5].

Example Test Case 7: Increasing with Some Decreasing
Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
Expected Output: 6
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80].

Example Test Case 8: Mixed Order
Input: [3, 4, -1, 0, 6, 2, 3]
Expected Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [-1, 0, 2, 3].

Example Test Case 9: Larger Input with Random Values
Input: [4, 10, 4, 3, 8, 9]
Expected Output: 3
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [4, 8, 9] or [3, 8, 9].
