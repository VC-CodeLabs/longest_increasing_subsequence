# Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing  subsequence .


Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/
 
**Examples:**
**Example 1:**</br>
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]</br>
Output: 4</br>
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**</br>
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]</br>
Output: 4

**Example 3:**</br>
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]</br>
Output: 1
 

**Constraints:**</br>
- 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 

**Scoring**</br>
- Solutions must pass all test cases, including edge cases; tests used for grading/scoring may not be the same tests provided as examples.
- Fast execution times will be rewarded, but solutions must, first and foremost, be correct and complete.
- If more than three languages are submitted, the fastest solution from each of the top three will be considered.

**Submission**
- All solutions must be submitted either via an MR into this GitHub repo or through email by Jun 21st at 23:59:59
